I have created these scripts for learning purposes and to automate certain tasks. Most of these scripts were designed as projects during my master's program, but feel free to use them.

## List of Scripts:

1. [SOLID](https://github.com/Bunkfer/SOLID) - Solid methodology.
2. [Simulacion](https://github.com/Bunkfer/Simulacion/tree/main/Automatas) - Simulation of Cellular Automata.
3. [EpiSolver](https://github.com/Bunkfer/EpiSolver) - Python-PyQt5 app.
4. [Criptovis](https://github.com/Bunkfer/Criptovis-django) - Python-Django app.
5. [Web-design](https://github.com/Bunkfer/Web-Desing) - Web Projects.
