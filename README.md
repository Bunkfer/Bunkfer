# My Work ðŸ˜„

<hr>

I have created these scripts for learning purposes and to automate certain tasks. Most of these scripts were designed as projects during my master's program, but feel free to use them.

## List of Scripts:

1. [SOLID](https://github.com/Bunkfer/SOLID) - Solid methodology.
2. [Simulacion](https://github.com/Bunkfer/Simulacion/tree/main/Automatas) - Simulation of Cellular Automata
